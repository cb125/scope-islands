# scope-islands

I'm Chris Barker (https://cb125.github.io/).

This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.  There is a draft titled "Rethinking scope islands," which is in press at *Linguistic Inquiry*.

The Haskell code (islands.hs) implements the fragment from the "rethinking" draft.  Try loading the code into ghci, then type "main".
