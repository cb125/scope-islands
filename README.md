# scope-islands

I'm Chris Barker (https://nyu.edu/projects/barker).

This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.

As of April 2020, there is a rough draft of a paper called "Rethinking scope islands" on the file draft.pdf.

The slides are from the 14 Feb 2020 meeting of the NYU semantics group.
The older slides are from the September 2019 meeting of Sinn und Bedeutung in Osnabrueck.

The Haskell code (islands.hs) implements the fragment in the draft.  Try loading the code into ghci, then type "main".

The paper "The Logic of Quantifier Raising" is a manuscript currently under review.  It provides background about Quantifier Raising, which is the main tool used in the scope island slides and code.
