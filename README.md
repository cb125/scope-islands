# scope-islands
This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.

The slides are from the September 2019 meeting of Sinn und Bedeutung in Osnabrueck.

The paper "The Logic of Quantifier Raising" is a manuscript currently under review.

The python code explores using syntactic modes of composition.  Try "python3 islands.py"
