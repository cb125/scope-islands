# scope-islands

I'm Chris Barker (https://nyu.edu/projects/barker).

This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.

As of 27 August, there is a revised draft of a paper called "Rethinking scope islands".

The Haskell code (islands.hs) implements the fragment from the draft.  Try loading the code into ghci, then type "main".

The paper "The Logic of Quantifier Raising" is a manuscript currently under review.  It provides background about Quantifier Raising, which is the main tool used in the draft and the code.
