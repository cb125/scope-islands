# scope-islands

I'm Chris Barker (https://nyu.edu/projects/barker).

This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.

The slides are from the 14 Feb 2020 meeting of the NYU semantics group.
The older slides are from the September 2019 meeting of Sinn und Bedeutung in Osnabrueck.

The paper "The Logic of Quantifier Raising" is a manuscript currently under review.  It provides background about Quantifier Raising, which is the main tool used in the scope island slides and code.

The Haskell code (islands.hs) corresponds to the semantics group version of the work.  Try loading the code into ghci, then type "regression".

The older python code (islands.py) explores using syntactic modes of composition to manage scope islands.  Try "python3 islands.py"

A draft based on the slides is currently under development--write to me if you're interested--
