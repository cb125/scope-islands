# scope-islands

I'm Chris Barker (https://nyu.edu/projects/barker).

This project uses syntactic modes of composition to explore scope islands.  There are two related papers:

As of 28 December 2020, the final or prefinal version of "The logic of Quantifier Raising", to appear in Semantics and Pragmatics.

As of 30 December 2020, the final or prefinal version of "Rethinking scope islands", to appear in Linguistic Inquiry.

The Haskell code (islands.hs) implements the fragment from the "rethinking" draft.  Try loading the code into ghci, then type "main".
